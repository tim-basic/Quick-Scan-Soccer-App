## What It Does

This application displays random numbers (0-20) and occasional images on a colored background that changes every few seconds. Players must quickly identify and call out what they see while performing other training activities.

## How to Use in Football Training

### Basic Setup
1. Position the display where players can see it during drills
2. Adjust the interval timing (1-30 seconds) based on skill level
3. Choose display mode: numbers only, images only, or mixed

### Training Applications

**Peripheral Vision Training**
- Have players focus on ball control while calling out displayed numbers
- Develops ability to process visual information without losing focus on primary task

**Reaction Drills**
- Players must react differently to specific numbers or images
- Example: Sprint when seeing number 5, change direction for images

**Cognitive Load Training**
- Combine with passing drills - players announce what's displayed while receiving passes
- Simulates game pressure where players must process multiple information sources

**Team Communication**
- One player calls out displays while others perform coordinated movements
- Builds communication skills under pressure

### Settings
- **Interval**: Adjust how frequently displays change (1-30 seconds)
- **Display Mode**: Choose between numbers, images, or mixed content
- **Font Size**: Increase/decrease visibility based on viewing distance

## Technical Notes

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript application that runs in any modern web browser. No installation required - just open the HTML file or host it online.

The training methodology draws inspiration from cognitive training techniques used in professional sports to improve visual processing and decision-making under pressure.
